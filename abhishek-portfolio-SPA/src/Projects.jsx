                      In this project I created a log-in form using core HTML,
                      CSS , JavaScript. Implemented client-side password
                      validation using regular expressions to ensure strong
                      passwords, requiring at least one uppercase letter, one
                      lowercase letter, and one number with a minimum length of
                      8 characters. Utilized Document Object Model (DOM) to
                      dynamically update and manage the form elements and
                      content.Employed various event listeners to handle user
                      interactions, such as form submission and input
                      validation, enhancing the user experience and providing
                      real-time feedback. Source code also uploded on my github

                      I used same technologies for this project also.
                      Implemented game logic using JavaScript, including win
                      conditions, turn switching, and game reset
                      functionality.Utilized the Document Object Model (DOM) to
